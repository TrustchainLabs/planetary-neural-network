 * background jobs related to DAOs. It processes jobs added to the 'dao'
 * queue by the DaoService, performing operations that may be resource-intensive
 * or require interaction with external systems like the Hedera network.
 * 
 * Using a queue-based approach allows these operations to be retried
 * automatically on failure and ensures they don't block the main request flow.
