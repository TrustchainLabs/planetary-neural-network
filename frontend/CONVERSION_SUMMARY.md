## What Was Converted

### ✅ Core Structure
- **Shared Types & Enums**: All TypeScript interfaces, types, and enums from the Next.js project
- **Services**: Authentication, Nodes, and Measurements services with RxJS observables
- **Guards**: Authentication and guest route guards
- **Interceptors**: HTTP interceptor for automatic JWT token injection

### ✅ UI Components
- **Common Components**:
  - Loading overlay with Ionic spinner
  - Tab component with hover/active states
  
- **Navigation Components**:
  - Left navigation sidebar with brand logo and tab selection
  - User tab with popover menu for logout functionality
  
- **Authentication Components**:
  - Login form with reactive forms validation
  - Sign-up form with user registration
  - Login and sign-up pages with responsive design

### ✅ Pages & Routing
- **Home/Dashboard Page**: Main application view with navigation and data display
- **Login Page**: User authentication with guest access option
- **Sign-up Page**: User registration functionality
- **Routing**: Protected routes with authentication guards

### ✅ Styling & Theme
- **Global Theme**: CSS variables matching the original dark theme
- **Ionic Integration**: Custom Ionic color scheme matching brand colors
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with responsive breakpoints
- **Component Styles**: SCSS files for each component maintaining original design

### ✅ Assets

## Key Features Implemented

### 🔐 Authentication System
- JWT token management
- Login/logout functionality
- Route protection with guards
- Guest user access option
- Automatic token injection in HTTP requests

### 🎨 UI/UX Fidelity
- Dark theme matching original design
- Responsive layout for mobile and desktop
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Consistent color scheme and typography
- Icon-based navigation system

### 📱 Mobile-First Design
- Ionic components for native mobile experience
- Touch-friendly interface elements
- Adaptive layouts for different screen sizes
- Status bar customization for mobile devices

### 🌡️ Climate Data Interface
- Tab-based navigation for different measurement types:
  - Temperature
  - Atmospheric Pressure
  - Wind Speed
  - Wind Direction
  - Air Quality
- Node selection and data visualization (placeholder for map integration)
- Add device functionality framework

## Next Steps / TODO

### Map Integration
The current implementation includes a placeholder for the map component. To complete the migration:
1. Install Mapbox GL JS for Angular
2. Create map component with marker display
3. Implement node selection on map clicks
4. Add popup information for selected nodes

### API Integration
Update the API base URL in `src/app/shared/constants/index.ts` to point to your backend:
```typescript
export const API_BASE_URL = 'https://your-api-domain.com/api';
```

### Additional Features
- Chart components for data visualization
- Real-time data updates via WebSocket
- Device management interface
- User profile management
- Settings page

## Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Start development server
yarn start

# Build for production
yarn build

# Run tests
yarn test

# Lint code
yarn lint
```

## Environment Configuration

Update environment files for different deployment targets:
- `src/environments/environment.ts` (development)
- `src/environments/environment.prod.ts` (production)

## Notes

- All service endpoints are placeholder implementations and need to be connected to actual backend APIs
- The project uses Angular 19 with Ionic 8 for modern mobile development
- Styling uses CSS custom properties for consistent theming
- Component architecture follows Angular best practices with module-based organization

The conversion successfully maintains the original application's visual design and user experience while providing a solid foundation for mobile app development with Ionic.
